    	\item Dead in trespasses and sins
    	\item Disobedient children....
    	\item Disserving of wrath
	\end{compactenum}
    \item \textbf{There are three evil powers that control all those that aren’t saved:}
    \begin{compactenum}[A.]
    	\item The course of this world
    	\item The prince of the power of the air
    	\item The lust of the flesh
	\end{compactenum}
    \item \textbf{There are three great qualities in God that made Him willing to save our souls:}
